Because each client interacts with the server using a local checkout, this probably means some means to work on sessions (which might seem like something that's not done in REST but in this case a session is like a working area that you create for manipulating its contents and finally commit back to the server and clean up. Authentication can be added via normal basic authentication, so there's no need to explicitly design that into the API.\n\nSo an interaction with the server could start somewhat like this:\n\nPOST /ace/client -> sessionid\nThis will trigger a basic authentication, which, if it succeeds, will return a session id. It makes sense to also implicitly do a checkout.\n\nGET /ace/client/mysessionid/feature -> list of feature id's\nWill return a list of features in the repository.\n\nPUT /ace/client/mysessionid/feature/MyCustomFeature\nWill create a new feature with a unique id called \"MyCustomFeature\". Maybe the put will also contain some (JSON/XML) data to describe the feature.\n\nIn general, we can map all our entities (artifacts, features, distributions and targets) as well as all our associations (artifact2feature, feature2distribution, distribution2target) to REST endpoints that are very similar, so:\n/ace/client/<sessionid>\n   /artifact\n   /feature\n   ...\n\nAnd for each of those repository objects (as they're called in the code) we can do things like:\n\nGET /ace/client/<sessionid>/<repositoryobjecttype>/<objectid>/tag\nTo get a list of all tags associated with object \"objectid\".\n\nPUT /ace/client/<sessionid>/<repositoryobjecttype>/<objectid>/tag/description \"This is a description.\"\nTo set/replace the description tag.\n\nFinally, for the 'checkout', 'revert' and 'commit' commands, we could do something like this:\n\nGET /ace/client/<sessionid>/{commit,revert,update}\nWhich will return success or failure.",
